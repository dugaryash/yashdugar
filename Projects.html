								<a href="LivaNova.pdf" class="active"><h2>LivaNova- Capstone Project</h2></a>
								<p> Currently, the focus of this project centers on comprehending the multifaceted and intricate causes of heart and lung failure. As a last resort therapy, ACS therapy has an alarmingly high mortality rate, yet some patients exhibit a higher likelihood of positive response to the treatment than others. In addition, it has been observed that hospitals differ in the types of therapies offered, as well as the degrees of success achieved with ACS and ECMO specifically.</p>
								<p>The project aims to uncover the patients who are most likely to receive ACS, taking into account both demographic and clinical factors. Furthermore, the research seeks to identify the factors that contribute to a greater success rate in ACS therapy, leading to an improved mortality rate. This involves exploring clustering algorithms that can group patients based on their outcomes and success.</p>
								<p>Moreover, the study assesses the distinguishing features and characteristics of hospitals that tend to provide ACS and ECMO therapies, and explores whether any clustering techniques can be employed to categorize patient outcomes. Overall, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive and insightful analysis of ACS therapy and its various factors, which will contribute to improving patient outcomes and enhancing the efficacy of healthcare practices.</p>
								
								<a href="H&M.pdf" class="active"><h2>H&M Fashion recommendation system</h2></a>
								<p>As a dedicated and passionate data scientist, I am currently undertaking an exciting and impactful project with H&M Group (Kaggle competition). This project involves leveraging extensive customer purchase history data, along with accompanying metadata, to develop highly accurate product recommendations. With a vast online store offering numerous products, ensuring that customers find what they need is critical to driving sales and enhancing the overall shopping experience. By analyzing and interpreting complex data spanning various categories, including product descriptions and images, I am utilizing cutting-edge data analytics techniques to generate recommendations that accurately reflect customer preferences and needs. Not only does this contribute to increased sales and customer satisfaction, but it also aligns with H&M Group's commitment to sustainability by reducing returns and minimizing emissions from transportation.</p>
								
								<a href="Neural Network using PyTorch.pdf" class="active"><h2>Neural Network from scratch in PyTorch</h2></a>
								<p>This report compares the performance of single-layer and double-layer neural networks implemented using PyTorch's built-in functionalities and from scratch. For the single-layer network, the scratch implementation involves creating classes for linear transformation, ReLU activation, and cross-entropy loss, and then combining them to form the neural network. The PyTorch implementation involves defining the model using PyTorch's nn module, setting the loss function and optimization method, and training the model using PyTorch's autograd function. Results show that both implementations perform well, with no overfitting observed. Additionally, the performance of a double-layer neural network is also evaluated using the same methodology.</p>
								
								<a href="https://www.stat.cmu.edu/capstoneresearch/600files/poster1.pdf" class="active"><h2>Developing a Predictive Model for Hospital Ratings</h2></a>
								<p>Our study aimed to develop a predictive model for the rating of American hospitals using various predictor variables, such as facility type, cost, quality, and value of different procedures. Our results revealed that Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms provided the best performance in predicting the hospital's rating, with an overall misclassification rate of only 16-17%. Additionally, we found that hospital safety and readmission ratings were the most important features when determining the overall rating of a hospital, followed by the experience rating. This study highlights the significance of improving hospital safety and reducing readmission rates to enhance overall hospital ratings, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes for patients.</p>
								
								<a href="Loan Repayment Forecasting.pptx" class="active"><h2>Loan Repayment Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms</h2></a>
								<p>The study undertaken delved into the utilization of machine learning algorithms to forecast the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan payments in the lending industry. To achieve this, the study made use of data obtained from Lending Club, which was utilized to train various machine learning models such as KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.</p>
								<p>The study employed a variety of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC metrics, which were utilized to compare the performance of the various models. After conducting a thorough evaluation, the Random Forest model emerged as the top-performing model, recording an impressive AUC score of 0.68.</p>
								<p>Overall, this study has successfully demonstrated the viability of utilizing machine learning algorithms in loan repayment prediction, thereby opening up new possibilities for the lending industry to develop more effective risk assessment tools.</p>
