								<p>As a seasoned Decision Analytics Consultant at ZS Associates, a prominent management consulting firm, I have had the privilege of working with some of the most renowned healthcare and medical device companies. In my role as a Decision Analytics Associate Consultant, my foremost responsibility was to study and analyze the market, while devising a roadmap strategy for future success through data-driven insights. My projects primarily focused on sizing and segmentation, and I utilized cutting-edge Python techniques to evaluate both quantitative and behavioral attributes of healthcare professionals, hospitals and physicians. These insights helped identify customer needs and design tailored targeting strategies, resulting in effective communication and personalized marketing. Additionally, I delivered online and in-person training sessions for over 300 new hires, covering Python, SQL, and Excel, and acted as a mentor to 20+ associates, guiding them in their respective roles and responsibilities.</p>
								<p>At ZS Associates, I spearheaded a pivotal project that involved determining the pipeline and cross-selling opportunities for the commercial integration of two major healthcare firms. I employed predictive modeling and analyzed large data sets to identify potential areas of growth and collaborated with clients to develop strategic growth priorities for their markets in over 20 countries. I also designed the organizational structure and size for the combined firm, factoring in discussions with clients and our expertise, and developed a complex model that calculated the overall workload to generate optimum ROI. The end result was increased revenues and market share for the clients. My team was awarded the prestigious Project Champions award in recognition of our outstanding efforts. Furthermore, I led a team of 6 (with over 200 participants) in a case study that involved identifying actionable steps to increase overall sales for a pharmaceutical client. Leveraging regression techniques and predictive analytics, we analyzed data and forecasted future revenue, and our team was ranked first in the competition.</p>
								<p>Prior to my roles at ZS Associates, I served as a Business Analyst Intern at Snapdeal, a prominent e-commerce site in India, where I employed machine learning models and Python to predict the validity of an address entered by a consumer, resulting in a remarkable increase in overall revenue of approximately ~15%. I utilized the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to design the probability matrix, which was employed at the backend to identify the legitimacy of an address. Additionally, I leveraged SQL to examine data from online advertisements and prepared a comprehensive analysis of the quantitative impact on product sales. With the aid of visualization techniques on Tableau, I presented this analysis to the team and provided actionable insights for optimizing online advertisement campaigns, thereby garnering a strong understanding of the e-commerce industry and its key drivers.</p>
