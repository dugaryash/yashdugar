								<h1>Certifications</h1>
								<h3>Mathematics for Machine Learning</h3>
								<p>Mathematics for Machine Learning is a comprehensive series of courses that equips participants with a strong foundation in linear algebra, optimization, and machine learning algorithms. The courses cover various mathematical concepts and techniques used in machine learning, such as matrix algebra, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, singular value decomposition, and gradient descent. The course also teaches participants how to apply these concepts to real-world problems, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models such as neural networks. By completing the series, I gained a deep understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of machine learning and am well-equipped to apply these concepts in practice.</p>
								<h3>Statistics with Python Specialization</h3>
								<p>The Statistics with Python Specialization is an excellent program that provides a solid foundation in statistical analysis using Python. The courses cover a wide range of topics, including data collection, summary and visualization, estimation, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and advanced statistical modeling. By completing the series, I gained practical experience in applying statistical techniques to real-world problems using Python programming language. The courses also taught me how to use popular statistical libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze and visualize data. Overall, this specialization provided me with a strong understanding of statistical concepts and techniques, as well as the skills necessary to conduct data analyses and interpret results using Python.</p>
								<h3>Probability Theory for Data Science</h3>
								<p>Probability Theory for Data Science is an excellent course that provides a strong foundation in the principles of probability theory and its applications in data science. The course covers a wide range of topics, including the basics of probability theory, probability distributions, Bayes' theorem, random variables, and statistical inference. By completing the course, I gained a thorough understanding of probability theory, which is essential for developing and interpreting data-driven models in data science. The course also provided me with hands-on experience in using Python to apply probability theory to real-world problems, such as hypothesis testing and parameter estimation. Overall, the course was an excellent learning experience that equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively apply probability theory in data science.</p>
								
								<h1>Awards</h1>
								<h3>Project Champion</h3>
								<p>I spearheaded a successful project at ZS Associates where I identified growth opportunities and designed the organizational structure for the commercial integration of two healthcare firms. I utilized predictive modeling and data analysis to develop strategic growth priorities and a workload model that generated an optimum ROI. Our team was recognized with the Project Champions award in 2019 for outstanding performance, as we were able to increase revenues and market share for clients in over 20 countries.</p>
								<h3>Case Competition Winner</h3>
								<p>I led a successful case study competition, in a Business Consulting Bootcamp, where we analyzed data using regression techniques and predictive analytics to identify actionable steps to increase overall sales. Our team's efforts were recognized, as we ranked first among more than 200 participants in the competition. We also developed a revenue forecast using our analysis to help guide the client's decision-making process.</p>
								<h3>Math Olympiad</h3>
								<p>I achieved a top 2000 worldwide ranking in the International Olympiad of Mathematics and earned a Gold Medal for being the highest-scoring student in my school.</p>
