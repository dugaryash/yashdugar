								<p>Mathematics of Machine Learning: This course provided a deep dive into the mathematical foundations of machine learning. We started with calculus and covered topics such as limits, derivatives, and integrals, which are essential for understanding optimization techniques used in machine learning, such as gradient descent. We also studied linear algebra, including matrix operations, eigenvectors, and eigenvalues, which are fundamental to many machine learning algorithms, such as PCA and singular value decomposition (SVD). Additionally, we learned about probability theory, including random variables, distributions, and conditional probability, which are used in modeling and analyzing uncertainty in machine learning models.</p>

								<p><b><u>Linear Algebra for Data Science:</u></b> This course focused specifically on linear algebra concepts and their applications in data science. We studied topics such as matrix operations, including matrix multiplication, addition, and subtraction, as well as eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which are fundamental concepts in linear algebra. We also learned about linear transformations, which are used in machine learning algorithms such as PCA and SVD. The course was designed to provide a strong foundation in linear algebra concepts that are relevant to data science and machine learning.</p>

<p><b><u>Modern Programming for Data Science:</u></b> This course was designed to provide an introduction to popular programming languages used in data science, such as Python and R. We learned about data manipulation and visualization using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We also learned about machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, which provides a range of machine learning algorithms and tools. Additionally, we covered basic programming concepts, including loops, conditional statements, and functions.</p>

<p><b><u>Overview of Statistical Learning and Modeling:</u></b> This course provided an introduction to statistical learning and modeling techniques used in machine learning. We started with linear regression, which is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. We also studied logistic regression, which is used for binary classification problems, as well as decision trees, which are used for both classification and regression problems. We learned about model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation and the bias-variance tradeoff, which are used to assess the performance of machine learning models.</p>

<p><b><u>Introduction to Large-Scale Computing in Science:</u></b> This course provided an overview of distributed computing techniques and tools used for large-scale data processing. We studied tools such as Hadoop and Spark, which are used for distributed computing, and we gained experience using cloud computing platforms such as AWS and GCP. Additionally, we learned about data storage and retrieval techniques, including SQL and NoSQL databases, which are commonly used in large-scale data processing.</p>

<p>Overall, these courses provided a comprehensive overview of the mathematical and computational foundations of data science and machine learning. I gained a deep understanding of key concepts and techniques used in these fields, which will be valuable as I continue to develop and implement machine learning algorithms and models in real-world applications.</p>
