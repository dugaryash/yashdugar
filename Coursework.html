								<h2>How I built a strong foundation in data analytics and machine learning through a comprehensive coursework</h2>
								<p>Through my one-year course in data analytics, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the foundational mathematics, statistics, and programming skills that form the bedrock of computational modeling, analytical tools, and machine learning. My education was enriched through an industry-partnered capstone project with LivaNova, which provided me with the opportunity to apply my foundational skills to real-world problems.</p>
								<p>The coursework was designed to build and develop the skills necessary for a professional data scientist. I was immersed in the mathematics behind different machine learning algorithms such as gradient descent, probability and expectation values, principle component analysis, and more. We also learned about linear algebra, which helped us understand the role that matrices, vector space, vector basis, etc. play in simplifying complex problems and in various machine learning algorithms.</p>
								<p>Moreover, the Modern programming in data science course provided hands-on experience with advanced Python, SQL, Git, etc. The Large Scale programming coursework took us through PySpark and Pytorch. The Machine Learning techniques course deep-dived into various machine learning algorithms, and the Neural Network coursework helped us understand concepts such as backpropagation, depth, and height of network, among others.</p>
								<p>The statistics courses made us familiar with different statistical techniques, various probability distributions, and inference vs. descriptive statistics. Additionally, I have taken up courses to learn how to use various visualization tools commonly used across different businesses, as well as a course in business communication, which has helped me deliver my results to business leaders in the best way possible.</p>
								<p>Overall, my education and continued learning in the field of data science have equipped me with a versatile skill set, allowing me to approach problems from multiple angles and deliver impactful results.</p>
